## Project description

Fatal Exception is an interactive, text based adventure game that provides the user with a bite-sized role playing experience where danger lurks around every corner. Take advantage of player customization and build your hero as a warrior, a mage, or even a thief! Battle ferocious foes and menacing monsters in your quest to defeat the endless tormenter: Infinite Loop. Every playthough requires a different strategyâ€”will you survive and claim untold riches and glory, flee to fight another day, or succumb to your peril?

## How to compile and run the program

```bash
cd FatalException
javac src/fatalexception/*.java -d ./
java src/fatalexception/FatalException
```

## UI Design

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.
