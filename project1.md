## Project description

Fatal Exception is an interactive, text based adventure game that provides the user with a bite-sized role playing experience where danger lurks around every corner. Take advantage of player customization and build your hero as a warrior, a mage, or even a thief! Battle ferocious foes and menacing monsters in your quest to defeat the endless tormenter: Infinite Loop. Every playthough requires a different strategy—will you survive and claim untold riches and glory, flee to fight another day, or succumb to your peril?

## How to compile and run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

```bash
cd ./project
python setup.py
```

If the programming language does not require compilation, the update the heading to be “How to run the program.” If your application is deployed on a remote service, including instructions on how to deploy it.

## UI Design

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.
